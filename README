Installation Instructions:
To install, please first install the patch posted on Piazza. Once you have done that, you can run the install_script.sh
to download and install the latest version of the code from my github repository. We are also including the files 
in case you would like to manually install them.

There are three serparate #ifdef 
trees implemented into our code in the file schedule.c:

/* 
 * If this is defined the scheduler will run dynamic
 * assignment of tickets for priority raising or lowering.
 * SHOULD NOT BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH EXPR_PRIORITY
 */
/*#define DYNAMIC_PRIORITY*/
/* 
 * If this is defined the scheduler will run our own
 * personal ticket assignment. (Which could be hilariously bad)
 * Idea: Double tickets to those who don't get chosen
 * in the initial lottery (version below)
 * And set tickets to 1 when you use your quantum
 * SHOULD NOT BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH DYNAMIC_PRIORITY
 */
/*#define EXPR_PRIORITY*/

As you can see, do not define both of these, as very odd results will occur.
If you define neither of them, the basic lottery scheduling will take place.

Choose your desired lottery scheduling type and re-install schedule.c.
